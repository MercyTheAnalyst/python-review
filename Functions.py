## I decided to revise my knowlwdfe on pythonas it has been a while I got my hands dirty with it. Here is a quick summary of sample codes on simple built-in functions:

# string to experiment with: place
place = "poolhouse"

# Use upper() on place
place_up = place.upper()

# Print out place and place_up
print(place)
print(place_up)

# Print out the number of o's in place
place_o = place.count("o")
print(place_o)


## Samples of some methods on lists:
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Use append twice to add poolhouse and garage size
areas.append(24.5)
areas.append(15.45)

# Print out areas
print(areas)

# Reverse the orders of the elements in areas
areas.reverse()

# Print out areas
print(areas)

## Methods vs Functions: Unlike standalone functions, methods are called on objects using dot notation. 
# Import the math package
import math

# Calculate C
C = 2 * 0.43 * math.pi

# Calculate A
A = math.pi * 0.43 ** 2

print("Circumference: " + str(C))
print("Area: " + str(A))
